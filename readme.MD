The `AgentRunner` is a Spring component designed to monitor CI/CD workflow runs and respond to repeated failures. Here's a summary of its functionality:
1. **Dependencies**:
    - It depends on three services:
        - `GitHubService`: Fetches CI workflow runs data and related logs from GitHub, and creates GitHub issues.
        - `DiagnosisService`: Analyzes CI/CD logs to determine the cause of failures.
        - `AlertService`: Sends alerts when certain thresholds are met.

2. **Scheduled Task**:
    - The `runAgent` method is scheduled to execute every 60 seconds (`@Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000)`).

3. **Failure Monitoring**:
    - It fetches the most recent CI/CD workflow runs from GitHub.
    - Counts the number of runs with a conclusion labeled as "failure".

4. **Notification & Diagnosis**:
    - If 3 or more failures are detected:
        - It fetches logs from the most recent failure.
        - Analyzes the logs to determine the reason for the failures.
        - Sends an alert with the detected issue.
        - Creates a GitHub issue summarizing the diagnosed problem for further action.

In short, the `AgentRunner` automates the identification and diagnosis of recurring CI/CD failures and generates alerts along with GitHub issues for better tracking and resolution.
